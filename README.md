Problem & Solution :  Children in areas, where the air quality problem is serious, have a reduced lung capacity and have more respiratory problems, together with the effects on their nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems. All kids as well as adults with asthma may notice that they need to increase their use of reliever medication on days when levels of air pollution are higher than average. In order to prevent periods of symptoms one must always be in environmentally friendly areas. For example, many schools are next to or near roads with harmful levels of noxious traffic fumes. Besides that, factors like noise level can affect children’s performance. Therefore, before selecting a school for their kids, parents must consider environmental conditions where their kids are going to spend significant amount of their time. This kind of consideration applies almost to any property that people may decide to get or to build. Our app allows people to choose the proper area, then it uses factors significant to the user and open data sets to analyze that particular area and gives the feedback.
