Introduction

Problem & Solution :  Children in areas, where the air quality problem is serious, have a reduced lung capacity and have more respiratory problems, together with the effects on their nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems. All kids as well as adults with asthma may notice that they need to increase their use of reliever medication on days when levels of air pollution are higher than average. In order to prevent periods of symptoms one must always be in environmentally friendly areas. For example, many schools are next to or near roads with harmful levels of noxious traffic fumes. Besides that, factors like noise level can affect children’s performance. Therefore, before selecting a school for their kids, parents must consider environmental conditions where their kids are going to spend significant amount of their time. This kind of consideration applies almost to any property that people may decide to get or to build. Our app allows people to choose the proper area, then it uses factors significant to the user and open data sets to analyze that particular area and gives the feedback. Moreover, it analyzes all locations nearby in order to suggest places with suitable conditions. Furthermore, our app prevents people from staying in hazardous areas by sending instant notifications.

Application



                 


You can choose from your current location or location from the map that you are interested in.

Your current location can notify you everytime the value of those attributes (CO2,NO2, SO2, PM2.5, PM10, Humidity, Noise) changes significantly when you enter some area, such as change from Moderate to Unhealthy Zone.


       



Then user can decide which location they want from statistics we provided below


 

They can compare them to others. It might seem hard for user to compare all this graph each by each, but we provided this kind of data which composed of 7 graphs of each attributes and each of them has 12 values for each month. So users can compare only the attribute and period of the year they care about, and they can choose wisely using our information.

Lastly, after we retrieve information that user provide, we can use it to change our formula for calculating the score of each location. This is how we use application of Machine Learning in our project.
